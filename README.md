## Deployment

To deploy this website to GitHub Pages, follow these steps:

1. Deploy the project to GitHub Pages:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

This command will clean the current build, build the project, and deploy the
website to the `gh-pages` branch using the `gh-pages` package.

2. Visit your GitHub Pages URL to view your deployed website. You can also
   configure a custom domain for your website. If you visit the "Actions" tab
   in your repository, you can see the deployment logs and status. The current
   deployment workflow is set up to check that the ode is formatted, linted, and
   can be built before deploying, and can be manually triggered via running
   the `deploy` workflow.
